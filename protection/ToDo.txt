use strict math
multiple bandits/multiple peasants out of heap space
organize packages
drop support for dynamic equilibrium


match function:  alpha / beta in [0,1], no constraint on mu? 
MultipleBehaviorInteractionPattern:  matching function gives number of matches; 
calculate as percentage of bandit.size(); that percentage of peasants can be preyed upon
capped at 1.0
but costs are incurred regardless, for each number that the bandit selects.  
ParameterSpace should check to see if target class has a validate method, and if so, iterate through parameter points calling validate to ensure that only supported combinations are 
invoked.

Scenario support: 
protection statistics not printing the last record after governor says stop.  Compare:  Scenario_48_2013_02_12__06_16_31PM_Default scenario name and Scenario_48_2013_02_17__12_45_05PM_Default scenario name
from scenario sets 27 and 26

range parameter for doubles

typical scenario sets as actual acceptance tests:  
  role-shifting, 
  DST dynamic w/forced allocation for game theory
  role-shifting w DST & multiple survive/thrive thresholds
  multiple bandits/multiple peasants
 
 Known defects
 1.  DST dynamic is not completely disabled by setting s=0 and t=1, because a peasant with x=0 who is not preyed upon will thrive.
